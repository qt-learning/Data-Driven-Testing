# Data-Driven-Testing

This is the repo for the Squish Data Driven Testing course on Qt Academy.

## Getting Started

The files provided are the test suites and the demo apps used with the tests. They provide a reference for the workflows covered in the course section.

## Instructions

To get started with this project, you will need to have Squish for Qt installed from the qt.io website. We Recommend using the Squish IDE in order to follow along with the content in the videos.

suite_data_driven_section2: Example showing how to use findFile() to return file paths for test data tables within a test case or test suite. Tested with "Squish for Qt 7.2.0" package that supports Qt 6.5 applications built with MinGW 64-bit.

suite_data_driven_section4: Example showing how to create data-driven code. Uses testdata from data_1.tsv in Test Suite Resources to provide input for selecting buttons in the calqlatr app and expected output to compare to the displayed result in the calqlatr. Tested with "Squish for Qt 7.2.0" package that supports Qt 6.5 applications built with MinGW 64-bit.
